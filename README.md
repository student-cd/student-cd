## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**student-cd/student-cd** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ **Currently working on:** My PhD research into the genetic factors that contribute to schizophrenia. 
- ðŸŒ± **Currently learning:** R, Python, and Git.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** ~~my conspiracy theories~~ Linux, small non-coding RNAs and neuro-developmental disorders.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Open to collaborations:** If you're also researching the genetics of brain development and psychiatric disorders, let's connect!
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I use Arch btw
