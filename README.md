## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**student-cd/student-cd** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD research into the genetic factors that contribute to schizophrenia. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: R, python and git
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on analysis of small non-coding RNAs, their role in neuro-development and psychiatric disordes.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ~~my conspiracy theories~~ linux and small non-coding RNAs
- âš¡ Fun fact: I use Arch btw
